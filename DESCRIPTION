Description: We have created a simple fortress game that we commonly know.
Let's try to get to the point where you want, considering the effect of the wind blowing from the outside of an object launched!
For smooth visualization, I made it easy to understand using ggplot2 or animation package.
The speed is set to 0 or more, and the angle is set from 0 to 90 degrees (0 to about 1.57 because it is in radian).
